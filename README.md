# Overview
Project of Machine Learning course
The research question underlying this project is: Is it possible to divide the customers of an e-commerce site on the basis of their purchases in order to improve marketing communications?.We use Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) model, divided into different groups in order to hypothetically send marketing communications more targeted and meaningful, making communication between e-commerce and customers incisive and effective.
To classify customers  we proceed with the Cluster Analysis applying 3 different algorithms: K-means, fuzzy and hierarchical.
In the end, we use for the validation: internal indices such as Rand and Silhouette and the validity paradigm was applied to verify the hypotesis that there is no structure on the dataset. 
The dataset we used was found on kaggle.

# Software
We use of Knime software and  R where it was needed.
